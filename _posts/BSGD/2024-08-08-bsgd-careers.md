#### Tips ####

+ Keep learning and building your skills as a developer; continuous growth is essential in this field.
+ Employers are more interested in the projects you've worked on than just a list of skills.
+ Understanding and showcasing how you use AI in your work is crucial, as employers now consider it a necessary skill.
+ Write a blog or create a tutorial on a topic related to your field; this demonstrates expertise and initiative.
+ Differentiate yourself from the crowd; a resume and LinkedIn profile alone are not enough.
+ Leverage LinkedIn to connect with industry professionals and message them about your goals. The internet makes it possible to reach out to anyone.
+ Spend time preparing for technical and behavioral interviews. Practice common coding problems, and be ready to discuss your projects and the role you played in them.
+ Stay positive and be persistent. It is a challenging job market but things will get better.
