_OpenGL is not directly supported with Microsoft Windows. The OpenGL libraries have to be downloaded and loaded manually. GLAD manages function pointers for OpenGL. It is useful because OpenGL is only really a standard/specification it is up to the driver manufacturer to implement the specification to a driver that the specific graphics card supports. Since there are many different versions of OpenGL drivers, the location of most of its functions is not known at compile-time and needs to be queried at run-time._

### Download OpenGL Library ###

- Go to https://glad.dav1d.de/
- Set **gl** to **Version 4.6**.
- Click **GENERATE** at the bottom of the page.

- This will generate a .zip file to download.
- Right-click and select **Save link as...** to save **glad.zip**

</div>

- Create a folder called “glad” in the **ThirdParty** folder and extract the glad.zip inside of it.

### Add OpenGL Library ###

#### Add glad.c  ####

_The **glad.c** file is required because it contains the actual implementation that loads **OpenGL** function pointers at runtime. Modern OpenGL functions aren’t available directly from system headers, so **GLAD** retrieves their addresses from the graphics driver. Without including **glad.c**, the program will compile but fail to link since the function definitions are missing._

- **Right-click** on the **Engine Project** and **Add>Existing Item…**

</div>

- Navigate to the directory with the glad file **glad.c**
  - **Source\ThirdParty\glad\src**
  - Select the **glad.c** file to add.

</div>

- Right-click on the **glad.c** file and select **Properties**.
  - Select **C/C++>Precompiled Headers**
  - Set **Precompiled Header** to **Not Using Precompiled Headers**.

  - Select **C/C++>Advanced**
  - Set **Forced Include File** to "" (nothing)

#### Update Engine Properties  ####

+ **Right-click** on the **Engine Project** and select **Properties**.
  + Select **C/C++>General>Additional Include Directories**.

<div align="left">

</div>

  + Add the **glad** include directory.
```
$(SolutionDir)Source\ThirdParty\glad\include
```

</div>

> Repeat the **glad** include directory steps with the **Application Project**.
