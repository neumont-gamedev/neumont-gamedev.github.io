# College Costs in Utah - Important Considerations

This visualization provides a comparative breakdown of college costs in Utah. Please note that actual costs can vary significantly based on several factors:

* Public universities (University of Utah, Utah State, Weber State, SUU) typically offer lower tuition rates for Utah residents. Out-of-state students may pay significantly higher tuition.
* Housing costs can vary based on location, living arrangements (on-campus vs. off-campus), and number of roommates.
* Some programs or majors may have additional fees not reflected in these base costs.
* Financial aid, scholarships, and grants can substantially reduce out-of-pocket expenses.

*The figures shown represent estimated annual costs for the 2023-2024 academic year and are subject to change. Please consult each institution's financial services office for the most current rates and detailed cost information.*
