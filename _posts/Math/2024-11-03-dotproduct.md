_The dot product is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors and returns a single scalar value. It’s calculated by multiplying the corresponding components of the two vectors and summing the results. In a geometric context, the dot product measures the extent to which two vectors point in the same direction. If the dot product is positive, the vectors point in a similar direction; if it’s zero, they are perpendicular; if it’s negative, they point in opposite directions._

+ In this demo, it is `A` · `B` with `A` projecting onto `B`.
